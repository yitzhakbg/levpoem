## The Incredible Six Hours and What could have been

The six years following Israel's amazing victory in the Six Day War were marked by haughty bravado which made laughing stock of the Arab armies.

*How many gears does an Egyptian tank have?*</br>
*Answer: Five. Four reverse gears and one forward in case they're attacked in the rear. Haw, haw, haw...*

The 1973 Yom Kippur War exacted the price in blood for the pomposity. What is less well known is the fact that it was baseless. The supreme valor of the IDF was no less than vital in achieving victory, yet not enough on its own were it not for the statistically impossible concurrence of the, let's call them *flukes*. Chagi Ben Artzi lists them in [The Six Day War Scroll](http://mizrachi.org/new-unique-publication-in-honor-of-yom-yerushalayim/). Both Chagi Ben Artzi and Jeremy Gimpel in his engrossing film [*Six Days of Miracles*](https://youtu.be/8i3uIz7hoYs) make liberal use the word *miracle*.

It can be argued that Jeremy uses the word too liberally. Each so called, *fluke* is not a miracle in and of itself. Similar things have happened in the history of warfare:

The *miracle* then wasn't in any one of the events, but in the confluence of them all precisely at the moment the air attack was launched.

The flukes/miracles were unknown to the IDF at the time. They came to light years later. But the Arabs knew the truth and were not mistaken in holding that the Jews could never be so lucky the next time around (Yom Kippur, 1973). Although documented, non appear in any of the video documentaries.

We deal here with the chilling dimensions of the calamity which was so very close at hand. When viewed through the utterly statistical improbability of the concurrence of the events, one gets a sense of exactly **how** close. A thousandth of a hairbreadth is no exaggeration.

Blessed with hind site and accustomed to the magnitude of the historic air strike on the first hours of the Six Day War have blurred our senses of the the weeks preceding the war. The video footage brings us back into those days in the valley of death, but first,

### What do we mean by *A Miracle*?

In contemporary jargon, *a miracle* is often understood in an infantile sense, as if the speaker is too lazy to invest effort in finding a more sensible explanation for the phenomenon. In his [God according to God](https://www.amazon.com/God-According-Scientist-Discovers-Wrong/dp/0061710164), physicist Gerald Schroeder writes on where statistics break down. There have been exceptional cases of people winning the lottery twice. Conceivably there may even have been a three time streak once in the history of mankind, but the police will be on their way to arrest you for rigging the lottery long before your tenth win. No amount of pleading that you were [simply lucky](https://youtu.be/Oml3SJ0vSlk?list=PLPWR5AhNsc_FtelhtsBksz4L7vK2vRiQO) or claims of it's being statistically possible will help you. We'll sidestep the argument by seeing extraordinary luck and miracles as semantically equivalent.

### Flukes, Miraculous or Lucky <span><img src="/images/four-leaf-clover-sm.jpg"></span> Coincidences

All of these flukes/miracles occurred at the precise time of the IDF attack between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM:

1. Top Egyptian and Iraqi commanders including Air Force commander Lt-Gen. Sidqi Mahmoud and Field Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer were en route in an aerial survey from al Maza to Bir Tamada in the Sinai to meet the commanders of the troops stationed there that very morning. The Egyptian War Minister ordered all anti-aircraft units not to fire under any circumstances between the hours of 7:00 and 8:00 AM to prevent the plane's being mistakenly shot down. Taking advantage of the order, the anti aircraft teams were all in the mess halls having breakfast instead of on their guns at that critical moment. The plane showed up on Israeli radar screens and the request to shoot it down was denied fearing there may have been civilians on board, saving nearly the entire Egyptian high command. Participants in the aerial tour were later put on military trial and demoted; some were imprisoned.

2. The Egyptians dispatched four Mig-21's to patrol the Sinai skies daily, at half-hour intervals from 4:30 AM until 8:30 AM to detect in advance a feared Israeli attack. On that Monday morning, the Egyptian flights took place as usual – except for the 7:30 patrol! The deputy commander of the missing formation *"had been delayed at home for personal reasons…"* – namely, a morale-raising party, with belly-dancers, food, and drink in abundance, held for the Egyptian pilots the night before which ran into the small hours of the night. The party was intended as an preliminary victory celebration for the imminent destruction of the Israeli Air Force.

3. While the Egyptians did not detect the oncoming Israeli planes, the Jordanian army did. The Israeli airborne armada showed up on the screens of the advanced radar system in Ajloun but a mess-up in the code-words prevented the critical communication from getting through to the Egyptians.

4. The second IDF attack wave, following two hours after the first one, with no element of surprise, was met by anti aircraft fire yet incredibly, nearly all the IDF planes returned unscathed after having successfully carried out their mission.

For those interested, video footage of the IDF air attack, Operation Focus abounds on the Internet.

The undreamt-of success of the air attack accentuates how close calamity was at hand. If not for the flukes/miracles, the IDF commander Moti Hod would have been very *happy* (if such a term could be used under such terrible circumstances) had *only* a quarter of his air force been knocked out. No stretch of the imagination is needed to realize the tremendous casualties and destruction to Israel's civilian population in such a so-called *optimistic* scenario. There was no visible assurance that Israel would not have been defeated and annihilated.

In optimistic and realistic scenario, the Israeli air force would still be in tact, albeit cripppled, while at the same time, the destruction of the Egyptian and Arab air forces would be less than complete. That would commit the IDF to continuing air battles at the expense of support for the ground forces. The less optimistic scenario leaves one shuddering.

## What could have been and almost was

From Michael Oren's [Six Days of War](https://www.amazon.com/Six-Days-War-Making-Modern/dp/0345461924):

> For the mass of Israelis..., the ordeal was all-consuming. Throughout the country, thousands were hurrying to dig trenches, build shelters, and fill sandbags. In Jerusalem, in particular, schools were refitted as bomb shelters, and air raid drills were practiced daily. Most buses and virtually all taxis were mobilized, and an emergency blood drive launched. An urgent request for surgeons— *“in view of the tough conditions they must be physically fit and experienced”* —was submitted to the Red Cross, and extra units of plasma ordered from abroad. Special committees were placed in charge of gathering essential foodstuffs, for replacing workers called to the front, and for evacuating children to Europe. Upward of 14,000 hospital beds were readied and antidotes stockpiled for poison gas victims, expected to arrive in waves of 200. Some 10,000 graves were dug.

> ...Yet these gestures did little to relieve the sense of approaching catastrophe, of the Jews’ abandonment to yet another Holocaust. *“What are you waiting for?”* Hanna Zemer, deputy editor of the daily Davar, accosted Eskhol. He retorted with a description of Israel’s international isolation, of the massive casualties it would suffer. *“Blut vet sich giessen vie vasser”*, he concluded in Yiddish: “Blood will run like water.” Rabin wrote later of the mood: *“The days dragged on with their burden of nerve-racking meetings and consultations … Time and time again, we assessed the situation, foresaw options, stationed units, formulated plans—while our political leaders remained captive to their illusory hopes that war might be averted.”* There was talk of the widespread bombing of Israeli cities, of an entire generation of soldiers being wiped out. A popular joke told of a sign hung at Lod International Airport, exhorting the last person out of the country to kindly turn off the light.
> 
> The apocalypse appeared to have arrived when, for the first time, fire was exchanged on the Sinai border...
> 
> The sole bright spot in these otherwise morbid preparations was the unprecedented outpouring of sympathy from around the Jewish world. Volunteers arrived in numbers greater than Israel could absorb—preference was given to young, skilled, Jewish bachelors—and donations exceeded all forecasts. Mass demonstrations were held in New York and London, and emergency fund drives launched globally. *“For the first time in history, European Jewry is acting as one for Israel. All moral, political, and economic support is being mobilized,”* French Jewish leader Edmund de Rothschild wrote Sapir. From Paris, Israeli ambassador Walter Eytan reported on a *“total revolution”*, with French Jews willing to give blood, house evacuated children, even sell their artworks to raise money for Israel. Contributions poured in from non-Jews as well. Particularly welcome were some 20,000 American gas masks, supplied, ironically, by Germany.
> 

I was one of those volunteers. The real hero was my mother of blessed memory, who encouraged her son to go onto what was a death trap at the time, while parents of young American Jews in Israel were frantically exhorting their children to return home. By the time I signed up, the war had broken out and there were no flights to the Middle East. I arrived several days after the war at age 19 minus one month for a stay of two months, a stay which indelibly changed the course of my life.

Above, we wrote that the difference between extraordinary luck and a miracle is semantic. In reality, one knows the difference, as an individual and certainly as a people.

Miracles like these don't care if we believe in them or not. Or, as Ben Gurion put it so succinctly,
"In Israel, in order to be a realist you must believe in miracles.
