### Yitzhak Bar Geva

 About pages are no place for introverts like myself. Professional qualifications on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yitzhakbg).


 I've been a non-conforming adventurer from my earliest days in the U.S., tinkering with vacuum tubes and antennas back in the 1950's while the kids on the block played ball. My passion for computing began in 1966 and has never waned. I made Aliyah (literally _Going up_) to Israel at age 21 to become a combat soldier, a settler and raise an incredible family, enamored with software throughout.

### Colophon

This blog is built with the [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) static site generator using Tom Maiaroto's [hugo-redlounge](https://github.com/tmaiaroto/hugo-redlounge/) theme. [Icons](http://ionicons.com/) are from the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/).  It uses Adobe's open sourced [Source Serif Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif-pro) and sans-serif by [Raleway](https://github.com/theleagueof/raleway). Both Hugo which renders the blog and the [Caddy user-space web server](https://caddyserver.com/) are run in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.
