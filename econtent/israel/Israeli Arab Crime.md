## [Crime Rate among Israeli Arabs] (http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Police-look-to-appoint-first-Muslim-deputy-commissioner-444692)

### Usual Disclaimer ###

*Some of my best friends are Jews* is an old cliche in America, is understood as being uttered by an Antisemite. I don't entertain unrealistic expectations that anything I say or write will change the popularly accepted bias of Mitnachalim (settlers in Judea and Samaria) being rabid Arab haters. That frees me from the burden of exerting energy in attempting to sound more credible. I won't be believed anyway, but despite the fact that this is being written after 20 years of post Oslo Accords Arab violence, I don't hate Arabs. I recall once having picked up a hitchhiker who declared to be a leftist, yet sputtered: *"I hate Arabs more than you do"*. *Sorry*, I told him, *I don't hate Arabs*.
Yet reality is complex
