## It was only some of my cells

If I whip out a pistol and shoot someone, no court will acquit me of murder on the grounds that less than 1% of the cells in my body participated in the act.

Time to square up to the reality that humanity is comprised of nations. Nations are no more a mathematical sum of their citizens than an individual human being is a sum of his cells. The fact that the great majority of Dutch citizens took no part in rounding up Jews and some of them actively opposed, is unconnected to the fact that Holland rounded up Jews for transport to extermination camps.

By the same token, most Christians being docile law abiding citizens does not absolve their countries of actively persecuting, murdering Jews and of killing millions of innocent civilians in wars against their neighbors. Even when Christianity doesn't incite, it condones, turns a blind eye to evil. Centuries of infused Christian morality has left countries of the Christian world no less Christian than before even if most of their citizens no longer attend church or practice Christianity.

We can gain comfort from the gradual loosening of Christianity, but must accept that the process takes generations, doesn't occur overnight.
