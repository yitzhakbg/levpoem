## The Orchestra ##
Imagine sitting in the philharmonic concert hall, soul elated at sublime heights by the sounds of Beethoven's 5th symphony when, with no advance announcement, a musician dashes out from behind the curtains and runs to replace the cellist who gets up and leaves the stage. All that without missing a single note. No sooner can the audience regain their composure when two more musicians run on stage in close procession, one replaces a violinist, the other replacing the flutist. The symphony proceeds in perfect accord. Then, four new players replace their counterparts and the pace picks up with more and more player replacements in frenzying procession until none of the original musicians remain and yet the symphony proceeds in harmony with nary a glitch.
### Coordinated, cooperative intelligence
Two things are apparent here:
1. The orchestra is conducted and the player replacements are coordinated/orchestrated?
2. There must be collaborative intelligence orchestrating both the music and the perpetual musician swapping.

"*Conducted*", "*coordinated*" and "*collaborative*" imply a discrete, "*sum-of-its-parts intelligence*" rooted in the players as individuals, yet The player-swapping-orchestra (PSO) can be a model for higher intelligence transcending the individual players, guiding them as an organic whole.

## Ants as an orchestrated organism ##
Ant colonies are a popular, intensely researched example of superorganisms exhibiting higher intelligence. See this recently published research on how [Ants respond as a collective “superorganism” when they sense a predator](http://www.sciencealert.com/ants-respond-as-a-collective-superorganism-when-they-sense-a-predator). Superorganism research emphasizes the "*orchestrated*" nature of the collective but paint a static picture by ignoring the perpetual swapping of its players. Timed snapshots of the colony reveal that ants die and are replaced by newly born ants. Each new ant somehow steps in to fulfill the role of its so called, deceased swap-mate at the precise instant in time that assures the orchestra, the ant colony in this case, maintains harmony and the players are perputually swapped. It is fair to assume that each newborn ant in some subconscious way "*knows*" its role from the instant it arrives on the scene.

## The Gap ##
There is an unspoken axiom that the behavior of the collective, the colony, cannot be explained in terms of its players, the ants. But why? The behavior of each ant can be examined down into minute detail. The same can be said of examining the colony, and yet there is an unexplainable chasm, a gap, between the players as individuals and the collective in which each ant is an vibrantly active contributor. Such is blithely assumed for example in the study of microeconomics vs. macroeconomics with little or no attempt at all to address the scientific question of **how** the micro becomes macro.
